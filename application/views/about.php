   	         	 <p>To add value and contribute a lot more in information management system, a new project, Promoting Resilient and sustainable urban Growth by Augmenting DRR capacity of Local Authorities Through active private sector Involvement, PRAGATI, funded by European Commission Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection Department (ECHO) has been launched in two municipalities including where Mishra is mayor, the ChanguNarayan Municipality. Another one is Shankarapur Municipality in the Kathmandu district.</p>

             <p>  This project will help authorities and communities in many ways, including developing and setting up an emergency operation center at the municipal level. The action will also help municipal authorities learn about the proper management and use of data collected in the survey. This center will basically have information like what was collected during the survey, and there will be a separate stakeholder mapping showing the amount of schools, hotels, health centers in the area and whether they have plans to respond if any disaster occurs.</p>

             <p>  The project will also help them develop several disaster risk reduction and management plans so that the municipalities will be well equipped to respond to future disasters. A more exciting part of this project is the private sectors involvement in disaster management. DCA Nepal, ADRA Nepal and VSO has formed a consortium to execute this project through their local partners FSCN in Changunarayan Municipality and NDRC in Sankharapur Municipality.</p>
